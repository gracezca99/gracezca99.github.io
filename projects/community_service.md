# Community Service
  I've participated in a lot of community services both in the US and in China.

## Cheerleading for special needs kids

I love gymnastics since I was in kindergarten, and when I moved to China I joined the school's cheerleading team, and soon I became the team leader. We did performance and competition within China and internationaly, like Frankfurt, Taipei etc. 

We also performed for special needs kids, here are some of the pictures:
