### Grace Zhang
I am in 9th grade and I am 14 years old. I have an older brother who is 18 years old and a younger sister who is 13 years old, and we were all born and raised in California. My family and I relocated to China in the summer of 2016. We lived two years in Hangzhou and two years in Shanghai. In 2020, my younger sister and I went to Fay School in Massachusetts.
