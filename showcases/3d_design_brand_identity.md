    <p>In the Brand Identity unit, we learned what brand identity is, then we applied what we learned to make our own brand that represents us.</p>
    <p>The first step was to learn what a brand represents. I started by doing a brand analysis. Then, I designed a logo, and finally, the style guide.</p>

#### Brand Analysis
I chose to do a brand analysis about the logo of US Open. I analyzed both of their new logo and their old logo. Then, I compared them and analyzed why the new logo was better.

#### Logo Design
I wanted to design a logo that represents my idea of a simple and playful design. I started brainstorming my logo by thinking of any arrangement of my name and initials.

Then, I chose my favorite design and made different versions of it on Illustrator.

Finally, I settled on this logo:

#### Style Guide
After I had my logo and two of my main colors, I then looked for colors that fit with the current colors I have. I used the website [coolors.co](https://coolors.co/), and it automatically generates colors that go well together.

After I found the color, I looked for fonts that fit my design philosophy. I wanted to use one serif font to represent my “modern” aesthetic, while I found a sans-serif font to represent my “formal” aesthetic. Tothether, these fonts will help emphesize certain parts of my website.

Finally, I put everything into a document and made a [style guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/16GYu-9LOtND36e563b6rrRNAQWxzeM6Eq6v6oQ_3Cak/edit?usp=sharing).

#### Reflection
I learned a lot from making a logo and style guide based on my brand identity. As someone who is intrested in UI design, making an app/website aestheticly pleasing through consistency is important.

To improve my style guide, I think I should have chosen less colors and used the main color more often. This way, there would be more of a consistency.
