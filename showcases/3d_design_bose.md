    <p>The monument project was the first project where I went through the design process to build something physical.
</p>

#### Research
We went to the Bose Rapid Prototype Development Center in Framingham, where we got a tour of the place and got more information about our project. We learned that the Soundlink Flex is buit to be rugged and portable, and it was designed for customers who are going on a trip outside such as camping or hiking. 

#### Brainstorm
We brainstormed possible accessories for customers that could help them on their trip.

#### Decision Assistant
The decision assistant helped us rank the ideas we had based off of how we rank the qualities of a product.

#### Design Sheets
We made design sheets for some of our ideas. Bose designers came again to give us advice for our design. One of them mentioned that we could combine some of the ideas into one, and they also gave us some tips for prototyping.

#### Prototype
We chose to make a case for our speaker. We carved the shape of the case using foam. Then we vaccum formed it with plastic.

#### Presentation
We went to Bose to present our accessories to them. We made a poster.
