Inspired by the SPAM Museum, our project was to design a museum for a Hormel Foods company. Avery, Owen, and I were in a group. We chose to make a museum for Planters, a penut company.

#### The Plan
First, we did research on museums, including the SPAM museum. Next, we brainstormed possible companys to make a museum about. After, we designed and made prototypes of exhibits in the museum. Finally, we presented our museums to the SPAM museum.

#### Research
The SPAM museum gave us a virtual tour and gave us tips on how to make an engaging museum. Afterwards, my group and I did some research on other Hormel Food companies.

#### Brainstorm
We brainstormed what our favorite companies were based off of the research. After some discussion, we chose to make a Planters museum. We also brainstormed what exhibitions to include in the museum. To get inspiration on how to make it, we searched the web for ideas and made a mood board.

#### Design & Prototype
We decided to make the museum a peanut shape, with different exhibitions such as a life-size Mr. Peanut, a gift shop, and fun facts about Planters.

### Presentation
Finally, after we made the prototypes for the exhibition, my group presented our museum to the SPAM museum. We recieved positive feedback, as well as some areas for improvement.
