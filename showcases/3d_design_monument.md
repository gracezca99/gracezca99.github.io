#### Research
First, I made a mood board of my research of existing monuments to get a basic idea of what I would be building.

#### Brainstorm
I did research on Fayâ€™s history to brainstorm possible events to memorialize. Then, using the topics I listed, I jotted down any ideas I had for a memorial.

#### Design Sheets
I picked three of my favorite ideas and made a design sheet for each idea.
